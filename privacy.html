<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Effective date: <strong>2025-08-18</strong></p>

<p>
This privacy policy applies to the UrbanomeFit app (hereby referred to as the "Application")
for mobile devices that was created by UPCOM (hereby referred to as the "Service Provider")
as a Free service. This service is intended for use “AS IS”.
</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>The Application collects certain information when you download and use it. This may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your device’s Internet Protocol address (IP address)</li>
    <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, and the time spent on those pages</li>
    <li>Time spent using the Application</li>
    <li>The operating system of your mobile device</li>
</ul>

<h2>Location Data</h2>

<p>
The Application collects your device’s approximate geographical location. This information is used in the following ways:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Geolocation Services:</strong> To provide personalized content, walking suggestions, and map-based functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics and Improvements:</strong> Aggregated and anonymized location data helps the Service Provider understand user behavior and improve the Application.</li>
    <li><strong>Backend Processing:</strong> Location data is securely transmitted to the Service Provider’s backend server in order to generate maps, routes, environmental information, and personalized recommendations.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> Periodically, anonymized location data may be sent to external services to help enhance the Application and optimize performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Location data collected by the Application is <strong>never combined with Google Fit data</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Google Fit Activity Data</h2>

<p>
The Application connects to your Google Fit account using the Google Fitness API to read your daily walking activity, such as step count and walking distance.
</p>

<p><strong>Requested Scope:</strong></p>
<p><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/fitness.activity.read</code></p>

<p>
This allows the Application to read your activity data from Google Fit.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>No Google Fit data is stored, uploaded, transmitted, or shared.</strong></li>
    <li>All Google Fit data is used temporarily and only displayed to you inside the Application.</li>
    <li>Once the Application is closed, Google Fit data is not retained in any form.</li>
    <li>We do not request or access any other Google Fit scopes (heart rate, body metrics, nutrition, etc.).</li>
    <li><strong>Google Fit data is never used for advertising, analytics, marketing, or any unrelated purpose.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Google Fit data is never sold or shared with third parties.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
You may revoke the Application’s access to Google Fit at any time through your Google Account settings 
(<em>Security → Third-party apps with account access</em>).
</p>

<h2>User-Provided Health and Personal Information</h2>

<p>
The Application may allow you to provide certain health and wellbeing information directly, such as:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Weight or body-related measurements</li>
    <li>Activity goals and preferences</li>
    <li>Mood entries or wellbeing check-ins</li>
    <li>Other information you choose to enter manually</li>
</ul>

<p>
This user-provided health data does <strong>not</strong> come from Google Fit and is stored securely on the Service Provider’s backend systems. It is used only to provide the functionality of the Application, such as statistics, goals, trends, and personalized feedback.
</p>

<p>
For certain features, the Application may also require you to provide personal information such as your email address.
This information is used solely for communication or account-related purposes.
</p>

<h2>AI Chat Processing (OpenAI)</h2>

<p>
The Application includes a chat feature that provides activity suggestions, wellness guidance, and general conversational assistance. This feature is powered by the OpenAI API.
</p>

<p>
When you use the chat, the content of your messages is sent to OpenAI’s servers so that a response can be generated. This may include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your written questions or statements</li>
    <li>General contextual information (for example, weather or environmental conditions relevant to your query)</li>
</ul>

<p>
We <strong>do not send any Google Fit data</strong> to OpenAI. All Google Fit activity data (such as steps or walking distance) is processed locally in the Application and is not transmitted to any third-party AI services.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, the Application may send your <strong>approximate location</strong> (for example, city or general area) to our backend server in order to generate contextual chat responses such as outdoor recommendations. This location context may be included in the chat request sent to OpenAI. Precise GPS coordinates are <strong>not</strong> sent to OpenAI.
</p>

<p>
User-provided health information such as weight, mood entries, activity preferences, or wellbeing records is <strong>never</strong> sent to OpenAI. This information is stored securely on our backend and used only for the functionality of the Application.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>
