<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Effective date: <strong>2025-08-18</strong></p>

<p>
This privacy policy applies to the UrbanomeFit app (hereby referred to as the "Application") 
for mobile devices that was created by UPCOM (hereby referred to as the "Service Provider") 
as a Free service. This service is intended for use “AS IS”.
</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>The Application collects certain information when you download and use it. This may include:</p>
<ul>

    <li>Time spent using the Application</li>
    <li>The operating system of your mobile device</li>
</ul>

<h2>Location Data</h2>

<p>
The Application collects your device’s approximate geographical location. This information is used in the following ways:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Geolocation Services:</strong> To provide personalized content, walking suggestions, and map-based functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics and Improvements:</strong> Aggregated and anonymized location data helps the Service Provider understand user behavior and improve the Application.</li>
    <li><strong>Backend Processing:</strong> Location data is securely transmitted to the Service Provider’s backend server in order to generate maps, routes, environmental information, and personalized recommendations.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> Periodically, anonymized location data may be sent to external services to help enhance the Application and optimize performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Location data collected by the Application is <strong>never combined with Google Fit data</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Google Fit Activity Data</h2>

<p>
The Application connects to your Google Fit account using the Google Fitness API to read your daily walking activity, such as step count and walking distance.
</p>

<p><strong>Requested Scope:</strong></p>
<p><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/fitness.activity.read</code></p>

<p>
This allows the Application to read your activity data from Google Fit.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>No Google Fit data is stored, uploaded, transmitted, or shared.</strong></li>
    <li>All Google Fit data is used temporarily and only displayed to you inside the Application.</li>
    <li>Once the Application is closed, Google Fit data is not retained in any form.</li>
    <li>We do not request or access any other Google Fit scopes (heart rate, body metrics, nutrition, etc.).</li>
    <li><strong>Google Fit data is never used for advertising, analytics, marketing, or any unrelated purpose.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Google Fit data is never sold or shared with third parties.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
You may revoke the Application’s access to Google Fit at any time through your Google Account settings 
(<em>Security → Third-party apps with account access</em>).
